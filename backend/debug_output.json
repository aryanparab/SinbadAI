You find yourself standing before an abandoned gas station, its windows boarded up and a rusted 'Help Wanted' sign swaying precariously. Cars litter the forecourt, some overturned, others stripped bare. A thick layer of grime coats everything, a testament to the chaos that has consumed the world. The air is heavy with an unsettling silence, broken only by the occasional groan that seems to emanate from the shadows. This is your new reality, Sinbad. A fight for survival in a world overrun by the undead.",
