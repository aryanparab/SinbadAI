The jungle floor is a chaotic jumble of shattered metal, torn fabric, and unearthed earth. The air hangs heavy with the smell of jet fuel and crushed vegetation. Every rustle of leaves, every snap of a twig, sends a jolt of adrenaline through you. The helicopter's mangled remains provide scant comfort, and the silence is almost deafening, broken only by the distant calls of unseen creatures. You push onward, scanning the debris field for anything useful, anything that might aid your survival.",
