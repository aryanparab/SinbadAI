Buildings rise tall, casting long shadows, but the street itself is surprisingly devoid of people. A few overturned cars and shattered windows hint at recent chaos. A peculiar sight catches your eye: a lone hot dog vendor stands patiently by his cart, seemingly unfazed by the surroundings. The air carries a strange mix of exhaust fumes and\u2026something vaguely reptilian.",
